      "On May 22-23, 1948, the Alexandroni Brigade of the Haganah (which became the IDF) attacked the Palestinian coastal village of Tantura. After the village surrendered, an estimated 200-250 Palestinian men were systematically executed and buried in mass graves. The massacre was suppressed for over 50 years.",
      "The village of Tantura had a population of approximately 1,500 people and was known for its fishing industry. Despite attempts at surrender and raising white flags, Israeli forces conducted house-to-house searches, separated men from women and children, and executed male villagers. Bodies were buried in multiple mass graves, including one beneath what is now the parking lot of Dor Beach.",
      "The massacre remained largely unknown until 1998 when Israeli graduate student Teddy Katz documented it through interviews with both Palestinian survivors and Israeli soldiers who participated. Despite initial confirmation by veterans, Katz faced a libel lawsuit, and Israeli authorities have consistently refused to excavate the mass graves or conduct official investigations."
