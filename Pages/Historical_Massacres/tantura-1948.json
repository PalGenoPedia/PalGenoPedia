      "On May 22-23, 1948, the Alexandroni Brigade of the Haganah (which became the IDF) attacked the Palestinian coastal village of Tantura. The village had a population of approximately 1,500 and was known for its fishing industry. Despite attempts at surrender and raising white flags, Israeli forces conducted house-to-house searches, separated men from women and children, and executed male villagers.",
      "An estimated 200-250 Palestinian men were systematically executed after the village surrendered. Bodies were buried in multiple mass graves, including one beneath what is now the parking lot of Dor Beach. The massacre remained largely unknown until 1998 when Israeli graduate student Teddy Katz documented it through interviews with both Palestinian survivors and Israeli soldiers who participated.",
      "Despite initial confirmation by veterans, Katz faced a libel lawsuit and was forced under pressure to sign an 'apology' (later withdrawn). Israeli authorities have consistently refused to excavate the mass graves or conduct official investigations. No perpetrators were prosecuted. The village was demolished and Kibbutz Nahsholim was built on its ruins."
