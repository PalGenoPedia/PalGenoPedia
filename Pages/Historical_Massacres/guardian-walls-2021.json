  "brief_summary": "Operation Guardian of the Walls was an 11-day military escalation in May 2021 that occurred amid heightened tensions over threatened evictions of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah (East Jerusalem) and violent Israeli police raids on Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan. On May 10, after Hamas issued an ultimatum for Israeli forces to withdraw from Al-Aqsa and Sheikh Jarrah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired rockets toward Jerusalem. Israel responded with massive airstrikes on Gaza. Over 11 days, Palestinian armed groups fired 4,360 rockets and mortars at Israeli population centers; Israeli forces conducted over 1,500 airstrikes. According to the UN and Human Rights Watch, 260 Palestinians were killed including at least 129 civilians (66 children, 40 women). Israel reported 13 killed (12 civilians, 1 soldier). Human Rights Watch investigated three Israeli strikes killing 62 Palestinian civilians and found 'no evident military targets in the vicinity'‚Äîapparent war crimes. Notable incidents include the al-Wahda Street bombing (May 16) that killed 44 civilians when residential buildings collapsed, and the al-Masri family strike (May 10) killing 8 including 6 children. HRW also found Palestinian rocket attacks constituted war crimes due to indiscriminate targeting of civilians. The operation exacerbated Gaza's humanitarian crisis and sparked intercommunal violence within Israel between Jewish and Arab citizens.",

      "The escalation that became Operation Guardian of the Walls was rooted in events in Jerusalem. During Ramadan 2021, Israeli police erected barriers preventing Palestinians from gathering at Damascus Gate‚Äîa traditional gathering place‚Äîand violently suppressed protests. Simultaneously, Israeli courts moved forward with eviction proceedings against Palestinian families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem to make way for Jewish settlers. On May 7, hundreds of Palestinians were injured when Israeli police stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque compound during prayers, firing rubber bullets, stun grenades, and tear gas inside the mosque itself. International condemnation was swift, but on May 10‚ÄîLailat al-Qadr, the holiest night of Ramadan‚ÄîIsraeli police again raided Al-Aqsa, injuring over 300 Palestinians. Hamas issued an ultimatum demanding Israeli forces withdraw from Al-Aqsa and Sheikh Jarrah by 6 PM. When Israel refused, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired rockets toward Jerusalem at 6:05 PM, marking the beginning of the conflict.",
      "Israel's response was immediate and overwhelming. Within hours, Israeli jets struck over 130 targets across Gaza. Over the next 11 days, the IDF conducted more than 1,500 airstrikes while Palestinian armed groups fired 4,360 rockets and mortars into Israel‚Äîthe Iron Dome intercepted approximately 90% of projectiles headed toward populated areas. The first day saw the al-Masri family strike in Beit Hanoun where a missile killed 8 civilians including 6 children who were packing barley for animal feed. Israel claimed it was a misfired Palestinian rocket, but Human Rights Watch's investigation found evidence of a guided missile and no military target. The deadliest single incident came on May 16 when Israeli forces launched a four-minute assault on al-Wahda Street in central Gaza City, causing three multi-story residential buildings to collapse. Forty-four civilians were killed including 18 children. HRW found the buildings collapsed after missiles struck the road or sidewalk adjacent to them‚Äîthere were no evident military targets.",
      "The operation took place against the backdrop of Israel's 14-year blockade of Gaza and its systematic discrimination against Palestinians, which Human Rights Watch had characterized as apartheid just one month earlier in April 2021. The 11-day conflict killed 260 Palestinians (129 civilians according to UN/HRW, though Israel claimed most were militants). Thirteen Israelis died including 12 civilians killed by rockets. Human Rights Watch conducted in-depth investigations of three Israeli strikes that killed 62 Palestinian civilians total, finding 'no evident military targets in the vicinity' of any‚Äîconstituting apparent war crimes. A third incident HRW investigated was the May 15 bombing of a building in Shati refugee camp that killed 10 people (8 children, 2 women); Israel claimed senior Hamas officials were hiding there, but HRW found no evidence of military targets. The report also documented that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes through indiscriminate rocket fire at Israeli population centers. The operation ended with an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire on May 21, but neither side achieved strategic objectives, and Gaza's humanitarian crisis deepened significantly."
