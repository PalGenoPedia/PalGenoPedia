  "brief_summary": "Operation Cast Lead was a 22-day Israeli military offensive on the Gaza Strip from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. The operation began with massive aerial bombardment followed by ground invasion. Between 1,383 and 1,419 Palestinians were killed, including 333 children and 114 women, with over 5,300 wounded. The UN Fact-Finding Mission led by Justice Richard Goldstone concluded there was evidence of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity committed by Israeli forces, including deliberate attacks on civilians, use of white phosphorus in populated areas, and systematic destruction of civilian infrastructure. The report also accused Palestinian armed groups of war crimes for indiscriminate rocket attacks. Israeli operations included the Samouni family massacre (21 civilians killed), Al-Daya family strike (22 killed), and 'white flag' killings. The operation destroyed 3,540 homes completely and severely damaged 2,870 more, leaving over 20,000 people homeless.",

      "Operation Cast Lead began at 11:30 AM on December 27, 2008, when Israeli F-16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters simultaneously struck over 100 pre-planned targets across Gaza within 220 seconds. The opening attacks hit police stations‚Äîincluding during a graduation ceremony for new officers, killing 99 police personnel‚Äîgovernment buildings, and Hamas infrastructure. By the end of the first day, at least 230 Palestinians were killed. The surprise timing maximized casualties among security personnel and created widespread panic among Gaza's 1.5 million residents.",
      "The aerial bombardment continued for seven days before Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza from the north and east on January 3, 2009. The navy simultaneously shelled from offshore. Over 22 days, Israeli forces conducted what the UN investigation described as 'a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population.' The operation involved widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure including hospitals, schools, mosques, United Nations facilities, water installations, and sewage treatment plants.",
      "Multiple incidents documented by the UN mission and human rights organizations revealed patterns of violations: the Samouni family massacre where soldiers forced approximately 100 civilians into a building then shelled it, killing 21; the Al-Daya family airstrike killing 22 civilians; several cases where soldiers shot civilians carrying white flags; and extensive use of white phosphorus munitions in densely populated areas. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights documented 1,419 Palestinian deaths including 1,167 civilians, while B'Tselem reported 1,385 killed including 762 noncombatants and 318 minors. Thirteen Israelis were also killed, including three civilians. The operation ended with separate unilateral ceasefires on January 18, 2009, two days before Barack Obama's inauguration as US President."
