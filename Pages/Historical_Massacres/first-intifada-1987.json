  "brief_summary": "The First Intifada (Arabic: ÿßŸÜÿ™ŸÅÿßÿ∂ÿ©, 'uprising' or 'shaking off') was a sustained Palestinian popular resistance movement against Israeli military occupation lasting from December 8, 1987 to September 13, 1993. Triggered by a traffic accident in Gaza that killed four Palestinian workers, the uprising rapidly spread throughout the occupied territories. Characterized initially by civil disobedience, strikes, boycotts, and stone-throwing by youth, it was met with severe Israeli military repression. Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's infamous 'force, might, and beatings' policy led to systematic bone-breaking and widespread use of live ammunition against demonstrators. By the uprising's end, Israeli forces had killed 1,087-1,284 Palestinians (including 241-332 children), injured over 120,000, arrested tens of thousands, demolished thousands of homes, and deported hundreds. The Intifada fundamentally transformed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, leading to international recognition of Palestinian rights and culminating in the 1993 Oslo Accords.",

      "On December 8, 1987, an Israeli army truck collided with civilian vehicles at the Erez checkpoint in Gaza, killing four Palestinian workers from Jabalia refugee camp. Palestinians believed it was deliberate revenge for the stabbing death of an Israeli in Gaza two days earlier. The following day, December 9, massive protests erupted in Jabalia. When 17-year-old Hatem al-Sisi was shot dead by Israeli soldiers, the uprising exploded across Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank within days. What began as spontaneous protests transformed into organized, sustained civil resistance coordinated by grassroots committees and later by the United National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU).",
      "The Intifada was characterized by largely non-violent tactics: general strikes, tax resistance, boycotts of Israeli products, and civil disobedience. Palestinian youth confronted Israeli soldiers with stones and Molotov cocktails. The Israeli response was brutal. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin issued orders to use 'force, might, and beatings' and to 'break bones' of demonstrators. Soldiers systematically beat protesters, fired live ammunition at stone-throwers, and used tear gas extensively. In the first year alone, Israeli forces killed at least 300 Palestinians and wounded tens of thousands. By 1990, the death toll exceeded 1,000.",
      "The uprising exacted an enormous toll: 1,087-1,284 Palestinians killed (including 241-332 children), over 120,000 wounded, approximately 20,000 arrested in the first year alone (with estimates reaching 120,000 total over six years), 2,532 homes demolished, and 481 Palestinians deported. Approximately 160-200 Israelis (soldiers and civilians) were killed during the same period. International condemnation was swift‚Äîthe UN Security Council condemned Israel's response, and even the Reagan Administration criticized the 'harsh security measures and excessive use of live ammunition.' The Intifada forced recognition of Palestinian national aspirations, led to the Madrid Conference (1991) and secret Oslo negotiations, culminating in the September 1993 Oslo Accords which created the Palestinian Authority and promised future statehood‚Äîthough these promises remain unfulfilled over 30 years later."
