Israeli forces rapidly occupied the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula. During the occupation of Gaza, IDF conducted systematic 'screening' operations ostensibly to identify Egyptian soldiers and Palestinian fighters (fedayeen) who had infiltrated Israel.",
      "On November 3, 1956, in Khan Yunis and its refugee camp, Israeli forces conducted mass roundups of male residents. During screenings, curfews, and arbitrary detentions, IDF personnel systematically executed civilians. UNRWA Director for Gaza Affairs compiled detailed victim lists and reported to UN General Assembly that 275 men were killed in Khan Yunis and 111 in nearby Rafah. Palestinian sources documented 415 killed with 57 missing. Methods included shooting during curfew, execution after screening, and arbitrary killings.",
      "Bodies were buried in mass graves, including in the streets of Khan Yunis. UNRWA provided names, ages, and circumstances of death for verified victims. Despite international documentation and UN reports, no Israeli personnel were prosecuted. Israel withdrew from Gaza in March 1957 under international pressure, particularly from the United States and Soviet Union."
