  "brief_summary": "During the November 1956 Israeli occupation of Gaza Strip (part of the Suez Crisis), IDF forces systematically killed Palestinian civilians in Khan Yunis town and refugee camp. On November 3, after taking the town, Israeli troops conducted house-to-house searches for fedayeen, executing men on sight or after screening. UNRWA documented 275 deaths; Palestinian sources report 400-525. Victims were lined against walls and machine-gunned, or forced to jump over ditches before being shot. Mass graves discovered after Israeli withdrawal in March 1957 contained bodies of men shot execution-style.",

      "The Khan Yunis massacre occurred during Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip as part of Operation Kadesh (the Israeli component of the Suez Crisis). After occupying Khan Yunis on November 3, 1956, Israeli forces conducted what they termed 'screening operations' to identify Palestinian fedayeen fighters who had operated under Egyptian command.",
      "The killings began immediately upon occupation. Israeli soldiers conducted house-to-house searches, executing men on suspicion of being fedayeen. All males aged 15-60 were ordered to assemble for 'screening.' According to UNRWA Director's report to the UN General Assembly, soldiers lined men against the walls of the Ottoman-era caravanserai in the town square and machine-gunned them. In the refugee camp, men were forced to jump over a ditch dug along a school wall while soldiers with machine guns shot them.",
      "UNRWA compiled a 'credible' list of 275 killed. Palestinian sources documented 415 deaths plus 57 missing. Witness accounts, including from future Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi (age 8 at the time), placed deaths at 525. After Israeli withdrawal in March 1957, a mass grave was discovered containing 40 men shot execution-style in the back of the head. No perpetrators were prosecuted. Similar massacre occurred in Rafah on November 12, killing 111."
