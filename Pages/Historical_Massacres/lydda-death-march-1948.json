This 'death march' saw numerous deaths from thirst, heat exhaustion, and deprivation; survivors reported infants dying, people chewing grass for moisture, and soldiers preventing access to water.",

Allon became Deputy Prime Minister; Rabin became Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate (1994); Dayan became Defense Minister and Foreign Minister.
