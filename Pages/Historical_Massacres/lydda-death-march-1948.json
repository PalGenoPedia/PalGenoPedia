      "On July 9‚Äì13, 1948, during Operation Dani under the command of Yigal Allon (with Yitzhak Rabin as deputy), Israeli forces captured Lydda and Ramle. In Lydda, city-wide shootings killed hundreds of civilians; the Dahmash Mosque massacre alone claimed 70‚Äì250+ lives (estimates vary). Moshe Dayan's 89th Battalion participated in ground operations.",
      "Immediately after the takeover, expulsion orders were executed: the entire Palestinian populations of both towns‚Äîapproximately 50,000‚Äì70,000 people, including refugees‚Äîwere forced to march on foot toward Ramallah in extreme July heat. This 'death march' saw numerous deaths from thirst, heat exhaustion, and deprivation; survivors reported infants dying, people chewing grass for moisture, and soldiers preventing access to water.",
      "Total deaths are estimated at 400‚Äì1,000 (including in-city killings and march fatalities). No perpetrators were prosecuted. Allon became Deputy Prime Minister; Rabin became Prime Minister and Nobel Peace Prize laureate (1994); Dayan became Defense Minister and Foreign Minister. Rabin's memoir passages describing the expulsion order were censored in 1979, later restored."
