  "brief_summary": "The period 2022-2023 marked the deadliest years for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the Second Intifada (2000-2005). According to UN and human rights organizations, Israeli forces killed over 500 Palestinians during this two-year period, including at least 78 children. The violence occurred primarily through near-nightly military raids into Palestinian cities, particularly Jenin and Nablus, which Israel dubbed 'Operation Break the Wave.' These operations began in March 2022 following attacks by Palestinians inside Israel that killed 19 Israelis. The UN Commission of Inquiry found Israeli forces used 'unnecessary and disproportionate force,' applied combat rules inappropriately to law enforcement situations, and committed unlawful killings. The most high-profile case was the May 11, 2022 killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh‚Äîthe UN Commission concluded Israeli forces killed her intentionally or recklessly, violating her right to life. In 2022 alone, 220 Palestinians were killed (including 48 children), making it the deadliest year since 2006. The pattern continued in 2023 with 507 Palestinians killed by year's end including 127 children‚Äîthe deadliest year in recorded history according to Doctors Without Borders. Major incidents included the January 2023 Jenin raid (10 killed), February 2023 Nablus raid (11 killed), and July 2023 Jenin incursion (12 killed with aerial bombardment). The raids were characterized by excessive force, extrajudicial killings, obstruction of medical care, and attacks on clearly marked journalists and paramedics.",

    },
    "paragraphs": [
      "The escalation began in spring 2022 following a series of attacks by Palestinians inside Israel that killed 19 Israelis between March 22 and May 7. Israel responded by launching 'Operation Break the Wave'‚Äînear-nightly military raids into West Bank cities and refugee camps, particularly Jenin and Nablus. These cities had become centers of renewed armed Palestinian resistance with the emergence of groups like the Jenin Brigades (founded September 2021), the Lions' Den in Nablus, and the Balata Brigades. The Israeli operations involved massive deployments of troops, bulldozers destroying infrastructure and roads, use of live ammunition in densely populated areas, and increasingly, aerial bombardment including drone strikes. By the end of 2022, 220 Palestinians had been killed including 48 children‚Äîthe highest annual toll since the Second Intifada ended in 2005.",
      "The violence was not limited to armed confrontations. According to Middle East Eye's analysis, the majority of Palestinian casualties in 2022 were likely unarmed at the time of their death. At least 95 Palestinians were shot by Israeli soldiers as bystanders during army raids or while participating in anti-occupation demonstrations. Seven women and girls were killed, including 15-year-old Jana Zakarneh shot twice in the face while playing with her cat on her rooftop, and 15-year-old Fulla al-Masalma killed a day before her birthday. The most internationally significant killing was that of Shireen Abu Akleh, Al Jazeera's veteran Palestinian correspondent, shot in the head on May 11, 2022 while covering a raid in Jenin. Despite wearing a clearly marked PRESS vest and standing with other journalists, Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli fire. The UN Commission of Inquiry investigated and concluded 'on reasonable grounds that Israeli forces used lethal force without justification under international human rights law and, intentionally or recklessly, violated Abu Akleh's right to life.'",
      "The violence intensified further in 2023. In January, a raid on Jenin killed 10 Palestinians including a 61-year-old woman shot through the neck while watching from her bedroom window. In February, 11 Palestinians were killed in Nablus including civilians shot in the back while fleeing. In July, Israel conducted its largest West Bank operation in 20 years‚Äîa 14-hour assault on Jenin refugee camp using drones, helicopter gunships, and hundreds of troops, killing 12 and forcing 500 families to flee. By December 2023, Doctors Without Borders declared it 'the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank in recorded history' with 507 killed including 127 children. The UN Commission found Israeli forces systematically violated international law by applying combat rules to law enforcement situations, using disproportionate force, failing to distinguish between civilians and combatants, obstructing medical care, and conducting what amounted to extrajudicial executions. Meanwhile, settler violence also surged‚Äîthe UN recorded over 800 settler attacks on Palestinians between October 2022 and May 2024, often occurring with Israeli military acquiescence or participation."
