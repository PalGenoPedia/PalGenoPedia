  "brief_summary": "Operation Protective Edge was the deadliest and most destructive of Israel's military operations in Gaza, lasting 51 days from July 7 to August 26, 2014. According to the UN Commission of Inquiry, 2,251 Palestinians were killed including 1,462 civilians (299 women and 551 children). Israel reported 73 killed (67 soldiers and 6 civilians). The operation involved over 6,000 Israeli airstrikes and massive ground operations. The UN Commission documented numerous incidents constituting potential war crimes including attacks on residential buildings killing entire families, the Shuja'iya assault killing over 100 civilians, and 'Black Friday' in Rafah where 130-150 Palestinians died after Israeli forces invoked the Hannibal Directive following a soldier's capture. Israel systematically targeted civilian infrastructure including destroying Gaza's only power plant, 18,000 homes, 73 medical facilities, and 262 schools. The operation displaced 500,000 Palestinians (one-third of Gaza's population). Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented Israeli forces' use of disproportionate force, attacks on medical facilities, and targeting of fleeing civilians. The UN Commission also found that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes through indiscriminate rocket fire and extrajudicial execution of 21 alleged 'collaborators.'",

      "Operation Protective Edge began on July 7, 2014, ostensibly in response to escalating rocket fire from Gaza, but in a context of heightened tensions following the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank in June. Israel launched massive airstrikes across Gaza, conducting over 6,000 air raids in 51 days. The operation had three phases: an initial week of intensive aerial bombardment, a ground invasion beginning July 17 aimed at destroying cross-border tunnels, and a final phase from August 5 characterized by alternating ceasefires and continued strikes. The stated objectives were to stop rocket attacks and destroy Hamas's military infrastructure and tunnel network.",
      "The human toll was unprecedented. The UN Commission of Inquiry documented 2,251 Palestinian deaths, with 1,462 identified as civilians‚Äî65% of all deaths. Among the dead were 551 children and 299 women. Entire families were wiped out in single strikes: 18 members of the Al-Batsh family killed on July 13, 17 members of the Abu Jame family on July 20, 26 members of the Al-Najjar family on July 20. The Commission investigated 15 cases of attacks on residential buildings and found that in many instances there was no evidence of a legitimate military target, or the attacks were grossly disproportionate. B'Tselem documented 606 attacks on residential buildings killing 1,447 civilians. The percentage of women among civilian deaths (20.2%) was significantly higher than in previous operations.",
      "Several specific incidents stood out for their brutality. On July 19-20, Israeli forces launched a massive assault on Shuja'iya, one of Gaza's most densely populated neighborhoods. Over 100 Palestinians were killed in approximately 24 hours as Israeli artillery fired thousands of shells into residential areas. Witnesses described civilians being shot while attempting to flee with white flags. On August 1, after an Israeli soldier was reportedly captured in Rafah, Israel invoked the Hannibal Directive‚Äîcalling for overwhelming force without regard for civilian life. In three hours, Israeli forces fired over 1,000 artillery shells into Rafah, killing 130-150 Palestinians, overwhelmingly civilians. The UN described this as a 'moral outrage and a criminal act.' The systematic destruction of Gaza's infrastructure was also staggering: Gaza's only power plant destroyed, 18,000 homes razed, 89,000 damaged, 73 medical facilities attacked, 262 schools damaged. The UN Commission concluded there was evidence indicating serious violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes by Israeli forces, including deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Commission also found Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes through indiscriminate rocket attacks and the extrajudicial execution of 21 alleged collaborators. On the Israeli side, 73 people died: 67 soldiers and 6 civilians killed by rockets and mortars."
