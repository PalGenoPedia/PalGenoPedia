  "brief_summary": "On Friday, February 25, 1994‚Äîthe 15th day of Ramadan‚ÄîBaruch Goldstein, a 37-year-old US-born Israeli settler, physician, and member of the far-right Kach movement, entered the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron dressed in his Israeli army reserve uniform. As approximately 800 Palestinian worshippers prostrated in dawn prayer (Fajr), Goldstein positioned himself behind a pillar at the back of the prayer hall and opened fire with an IMI Galil assault rifle. He killed 29 worshippers and wounded 125 before survivors overpowered and killed him. Israeli soldiers present at the mosque closed the gates, trapping survivors inside and preventing medical help from reaching the wounded. In the protests and clashes that followed over the next three weeks, Israeli forces killed at least 25 more Palestinians, bringing the total death toll to 50-60. Rather than protect Palestinians, Israel closed Hebron for six months, partitioned the Ibrahimi Mosque (60% for Jews, 40% for Muslims), closed 520 businesses in the Old City, and sealed Shuhada Street‚Äîthe main commercial artery. The massacre and its aftermath transformed Hebron into a ghost town, strangling Palestinian life while facilitating settler expansion.",

    "paragraphs": [
      "Baruch Goldstein was born Benjamin Carl Goldstein in Brooklyn, New York in 1956 to an Orthodox Jewish family. In the 1970s, he became a charter member of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), a militant organization founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane. After graduating from Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Goldstein emigrated to Israel in 1983. He served as a physician in the Israel Defense Forces and later settled in Kiryat Arba, an extremist settlement adjacent to Hebron. Goldstein was an active member of Kach, Kahane's ultranationalist party, and was third on its list for the 1984 Knesset elections. Israeli press reported that Goldstein refused to treat Arabs, even Arab soldiers serving in the IDF, believing it violated Jewish religious law to treat non-Jews. He compared Israel's democracy to Nazism and wore a yellow star marked 'JUDE' in protest. In the weeks before the massacre, Goldstein made ominous statements and was involved in violent incidents at the mosque, including pouring acid on carpets. Palestinian authorities wrote to Prime Minister Rabin warning about Goldstein's dangerous behavior, but no action was taken.",
      "On the morning of February 25, 1994, the 15th day of Ramadan, worshippers noticed the unusual absence of Israeli soldiers from their normal positions around the Ibrahimi Mosque despite tensions the previous evening. At approximately 5:30 AM, as Imam Khalil Muhsen Jabari led hundreds in Fajr (dawn) prayer, Goldstein entered the Isaac Hall‚Äîthe main prayer area‚Äîdressed in his IDF reserve uniform and carrying a Galil assault rifle and pistol. He positioned himself behind a pillar at the rear of the hall. When worshippers prostrated (sujood position), Goldstein opened fire. He reloaded multiple times, methodically shooting prostrate worshippers who were trapped and defenseless. Survivors report the shooting continued for ten minutes. Some eyewitnesses claim they saw additional gunmen, though Israeli investigations denied this. When worshippers finally overcame Goldstein, they beat him to death. By then, 29 Palestinians lay dead‚Äîincluding children as young as 11‚Äîand 125 were wounded.",
      "The horror did not end with the shooting. Israeli soldiers present at the mosque closed the gates, trapping survivors inside with the dead and wounded, and preventing medical help from entering. When the gates finally opened, Israeli forces fired on protesters outside, killing more Palestinians. Over the next three weeks, as news of the massacre spread, Palestinians rioted throughout Hebron and the West Bank. Israeli forces killed at least 25 more Palestinians during these protests, including at victims' funerals. The total death toll reached 50-60. Israel's response was to punish the victims: a six-month closure of Hebron; formation of the one-sided Shamgar Commission whose recommendations all favored settlers; partition of the Ibrahimi Mosque giving 60% to Jews (who comprised 0.003% of Hebron's population); closure of 520 businesses and 1,800 shops in the Old City; sealing of Shuhada Street (the main commercial artery); and a network of military checkpoints suffocating Palestinian life. The massacre achieved Goldstein's goal: it did not stop Oslo, but it transformed Hebron into a strangled city, its Old City a ghost town, its Palestinian population subjected to daily humiliation while a few hundred extremist settlers lived under heavy military protection."
