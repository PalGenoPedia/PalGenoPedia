  "brief_summary": "The Six-Day War (5-10 June 1967) resulted in Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, Golan Heights, and Sinai Peninsula. During and immediately after the conflict, an estimated 300,000-400,000 Palestinians were displaced‚Äîapproximately half were 1948 refugees displaced a second time. Israel demolished three entire villages in the Latrun area and parts of the Moroccan Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. Displaced persons were largely prevented from returning under Israeli military orders. The war created the modern Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, ongoing for over 55 years, making it the longest military occupation in modern history.",

      "The Six-Day War erupted on June 5, 1967 when Israel launched preemptive strikes on Egyptian airfields, followed by ground operations. Within six days, Israel occupied the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula, Jordanian-controlled West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Syrian Golan Heights. The rapid Israeli victory fundamentally transformed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by bringing all of historic Palestine under Israeli control.",
      "Mass displacement began immediately. As Israeli forces advanced into the West Bank, panic spread among Palestinians remembering the 1948 Nakba. Estimates of those who fled or were expelled range from 280,000 (Israeli sources) to 400,000+ (Palestinian and UN sources). Approximately 175,000 were refugees from 1948 being displaced a second time. The displacement was not solely a byproduct of combat‚ÄîIsraeli authorities issued military orders preventing return and systematically demolished entire villages.",
      "Three villages in the Latrun area (Imwas, Yalo, and Beit Nuba) were completely destroyed by Israeli forces, their 10,000 residents expelled. In Jerusalem's Old City, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed days after occupation to create a plaza at the Western Wall. UN Security Council Resolution 242 called for 'withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied' and for 'achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem,' but Israel has maintained occupation for over 55 years. The 1967 displacement and subsequent occupation created the framework for the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
