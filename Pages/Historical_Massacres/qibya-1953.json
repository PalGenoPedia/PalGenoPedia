  "brief_summary": "On the night of October 14-15, 1953, Israeli forces from Unit 101 under Major Ariel Sharon attacked the Jordanian village of Qibya. The operation involved approximately 300-700 soldiers who destroyed 45 houses with explosives while civilians were inside, killing 69 people‚Äîtwo-thirds women and children. The attack was framed as retaliation for Palestinian raids but was condemned by the UN Security Council, the US, and sparked global outcry.",

      "The Qibya massacre occurred during heightened tensions along the Jordan-Israel armistice line. Following the October 12, 1953 killing of an Israeli woman and her two children in Yehud, Israel launched 'Operation Shoshana'‚Äîa large-scale reprisal attack on the Jordanian village of Qibya.",
      "Unit 101, led by 25-year-old Major Ariel Sharon, attacked with approximately half a battalion of soldiers. After a mortar barrage, demolition squads systematically destroyed homes with inhabitants inside using explosives and grenades. Sharon later wrote the operation was meant to be 'an example for everyone' with orders for 'maximal killing and damage to property.'",
      "The UN Mixed Armistice Commission condemned the attack as a breach of the Israel-Jordan armistice agreement. The UN Security Council passed Resolution 101 expressing 'strongest censure.' The US State Department called it 'shocking' and suspended economic aid to Israel. Despite international condemnation, no perpetrators were prosecuted."
