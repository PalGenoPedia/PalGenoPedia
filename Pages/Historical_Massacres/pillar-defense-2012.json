  "brief_summary": "Operation Pillar of Defense was an eight-day Israeli military campaign in Gaza (November 14-21, 2012), initiated with the targeted killing of Hamas military chief Ahmed al-Jabari. The IDF conducted approximately 1,500 airstrikes across Gaza. According to B'Tselem's field investigations, 167 Palestinians were killed, including at least 87 civilians who did not participate in hostilities (52%), among them 32 children. Over 11,100 Palestinians were injured. Six Israelis died from Palestinian rocket fire. The operation raised serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law, including lack of effective warnings, disproportionate force, and overly broad definitions of legitimate military targets.",

      "On November 14, 2012, at approximately 15:45, the Israeli Air Force assassinated Ahmed al-Jabari, head of Hamas's military wing, marking the start of Operation Pillar of Defense. Over eight days, the IDF struck approximately 1,500 targets across Gaza‚Äîincluding underground rocket launchers, arms-smuggling tunnels, weapons storage facilities, and residences of Hamas officials. Unlike Operation Cast Lead (2008-09), no ground incursion occurred.",
      "According to B'Tselem's field investigations published May 2013, the operation killed 167 Palestinians: at least 87 civilians who did not participate in hostilities (52%), including 32 children; 62 combatants; 7 targets of assassinations; and 11 of unknown status. The UN Protection Cluster documented over 11,100 injuries, including 3,374 children. Analysis reveals 80% of civilian deaths occurred in the final four days, when the ratio of civilian to combatant deaths reversed sharply.",
      "Six Israelis died from Palestinian rocket fire: four civilians and two security personnel. Palestinian groups fired 1,667 rockets toward Israel (ISA figures); 436 were intercepted by Iron Dome. Hamas also executed at least 6-7 Palestinians accused of collaboration during the operation. B'Tselem investigated nine specific incidents raising 'grave suspicions' of IHL violations, including attacks killing children working in fields, families in homes without warnings, and civilians during Arab foreign ministers' visit. The IDF Spokesperson initially admitted 'probable error' in strike killing 12 members of al-Dalu family, but MAG Corps later closed case without prosecution."
