  "brief_summary": "The Great March of Return was a series of mass demonstrations held weekly from March 30, 2018 to December 27, 2019, at five designated sites along Gaza's separation fence with Israel. Organized initially by independent activists including journalist Ahmed Abu Artema, the protests demanded Palestinian refugees' right to return to lands they were displaced from in 1948, an end to Israel's land-air-sea blockade of Gaza (in place since 2007), and opposed US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The protests were largely peaceful, involving families, tents, speeches, and symbolic activities. Israeli forces responded with massive use of live ammunition. According to the UN Commission of Inquiry, Israeli snipers killed 189 Palestinians and wounded over 6,106 with live fire between March 30 and December 31, 2018 alone (total deaths reached 223 by end of 2019). The Commission found that in all but two cases, the use of lethal force was unlawful‚Äîprotesters did not pose imminent threat to life. Among the dead were 41 children, three clearly marked paramedics (including Razan al-Najjar), and two clearly marked journalists. The Commission concluded Israeli forces committed violations that may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.",

      "The Great March of Return began on March 30, 2018‚ÄîPalestinian Land Day and the 42nd anniversary of mass protests against Israeli land confiscation. Organized by independent activists, the protests were conceived as peaceful demonstrations to draw international attention to Gaza's humanitarian crisis, the blockade, and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Five designated protest sites were established along Gaza's eastern border, several hundred meters from the separation fence. The protests were intended to last from Land Day (March 30) through Nakba Day (May 15), but continued for 21 months until Hamas announced their end on December 27, 2019.",
      "Israel's response was immediate and lethal. Israeli Defense Forces deployed snipers along the fence with rules of engagement permitting use of live ammunition against protesters. On the opening day, March 30, 2018, Israeli forces killed 18 Palestinians and shot over 700 with live ammunition. The bloodiest day came on May 14, 2018‚Äîthe day the US Embassy officially opened in Jerusalem‚Äîwhen Israeli forces killed 60 Palestinians and shot over 1,100. By December 31, 2018, Israeli snipers had shot 6,106 Palestinians with live ammunition, killing 183 during official protest days. Thirty-five were children, three were clearly marked paramedics, and two were clearly marked journalists. Another 3,098 Palestinians were injured by bullet fragmentation, rubber-coated metal bullets, or tear gas canisters.",
      "The UN Commission of Inquiry investigated every killing at the designated demonstration sites on official protest days between March 30 and December 31, 2018. Commissioners reviewed video evidence, medical records, ballistics reports, and conducted extensive interviews. Their finding was damning: with the exception of two incidents, the Commission found reasonable grounds to believe the use of live ammunition was unlawful. The victims 'were neither participating directly in hostilities nor posing an imminent threat' when shot. Commissioner Sara Hossain stated: 'There can be no justification for killing and injuring journalists, medics, and persons who were clearly not posing an imminent threat of death or serious injury.' The Commission concluded the pattern of violations may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. Notable victims included 21-year-old paramedic Razan al-Najjar, shot and killed while treating wounded protesters despite wearing a clearly marked white medical vest, and journalist Yaser Murtaja, shot dead while wearing press insignia. By the time protests ended in December 2019, 223 Palestinians had been killed and 28,939 injured. At least 122 Palestinians required limb amputations including 20 children. Israel has conducted no meaningful investigations, with all but a handful of cases closed without indictment."]
