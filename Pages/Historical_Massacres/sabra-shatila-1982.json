  "brief_summary": "On September 16-18, 1982, Lebanese Phalangist Christian militias entered the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and systematically massacred civilians. Israeli Defense Forces controlled the area, surrounded the camps, provided logistics support, and fired illumination flares at night allowing killing to continue. The Israeli Kahan Commission found Defense Minister Ariel Sharon bore 'personal responsibility' for failing to prevent the massacre. Estimates of those killed range from approximately 800 (Lebanese official count) to 3,500 (Palestinian Red Crescent). Victims were predominantly women, children, and elderly civilians, many mutilated and dumped in mass graves.",

      "The Sabra and Shatila massacre occurred during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon ('Operation Peace for Galilee'). After the assassination of Lebanese President-elect Bachir Gemayel on September 14, 1982, Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ordered IDF forces to occupy West Beirut, ostensibly to maintain order. On September 16, Sharon authorized Lebanese Phalangist militias to enter the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps, claiming they would 'mop up' remaining PLO fighters‚Äîthough PLO forces had evacuated weeks earlier under international agreement.",
      "For approximately 40 hours (September 16-18), Phalangist militiamen systematically killed Palestinian civilians, including women, children, and elderly persons. Israeli forces surrounded the camps, controlled all entry and exit points, provided logistical support, and fired illumination flares throughout the nights allowing the killings to continue after dark. Israeli commanders received reports of civilian massacres but did not intervene. Methods included shooting, stabbing, decapitation, mutilation. Bodies were dumped in mass graves or left in streets.",
      "The exact death toll remains disputed. Lebanon's official investigation documented approximately 800 killed; the Palestinian Red Crescent estimated 3,500; various international sources cite 2,000-3,500. The Israeli Kahan Commission investigated and found Defense Minister Sharon bore 'personal responsibility' for the massacre, recommending his removal. Sharon resigned as Defense Minister but remained in cabinet without portfolio, later serving as Israeli Prime Minister (2001-2006). Multiple international legal attempts to prosecute him failed."
