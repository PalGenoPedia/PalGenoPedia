  "brief_summary": "The Second Intifada (also called Al-Aqsa Intifada) erupted on September 28, 2000, when Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif compound in Jerusalem, surrounded by 1,000 Israeli police. The visit, amid failed Camp David peace talks, sparked Palestinian protests that Israeli forces met with live fire, killing 7 and wounding 300 on the first day. Unlike the largely non-violent First Intifada, the Second Intifada quickly became militarized, characterized by Palestinian suicide bombings targeting Israeli civilians and massive Israeli military operations using tanks, helicopters, and F-16 jets in densely populated Palestinian areas. Over five years, the conflict killed over 3,200 Palestinians (including 700+ children) and over 1,000 Israelis (including 300+ children). Major Israeli operations included Operation Defensive Shield (2002), the largest military operation in the West Bank since 1967, and the devastating assault on Jenin refugee camp. Israel constructed the separation barrier deep inside the West Bank, expanded settlements, implemented targeted assassinations, and maintained brutal siege conditions. The Second Intifada ended Palestinian hopes for statehood through negotiation, entrenched occupation, and created the framework for current conflict.",

      "text": "<strong>Historical context:</strong> Second Intifada erupted after Camp David peace talks collapsed (July 2000) and amid growing Palestinian disillusionment with Oslo process. Unlike First Intifada's civil disobedience, Second became highly militarized almost immediately, with catastrophic consequences for both populations."

    "paragraphs": [
      "The Second Intifada's immediate trigger was Ariel Sharon's September 28, 2000 visit to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, accompanied by 1,000 Israeli police. Palestinians viewed this as deliberate provocation at one of Islam's holiest sites by a figure they associated with past massacres (Sabra and Shatila 1982, Qibya 1953). Protests erupted immediately. The next day, September 29 (a Friday), after prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque, Israeli police fired on Palestinian demonstrators, killing 7 and wounding over 300. By October 1, violence had spread throughout the occupied territories and into Israel. Thirteen Palestinian citizens of Israel were shot dead by Israeli police during protests inside Israel proper. Within two weeks, 100 Palestinians and 10 Israelis had been killed. The uprising's deeper causes lay in the failure of the Oslo peace process: seven years after Oslo, Palestinians remained under occupation, settlements had doubled, movement restrictions had increased, and statehood seemed further away than ever.",
      "Unlike the First Intifada's stones and civil disobedience, the Second Intifada quickly became armed conflict. Palestinian militant groups‚ÄîHamas, Islamic Jihad, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades (affiliated with Fatah), and PFLP‚Äîlaunched devastating suicide bombing campaigns targeting Israeli civilians in buses, restaurants, markets, and nightclubs. The peak came in March 2002 with the Passover massacre at Park Hotel in Netanya (30 killed), triggering Israel's massive Operation Defensive Shield. Israel responded with overwhelming military force: helicopter gunships, F-16 fighter jets, tanks, and bulldozers deployed in densely populated Palestinian areas. Targeted assassinations by helicopter missile strikes often killed bystanders. Entire cities were placed under curfew for months. The 2002 siege of Jenin refugee camp became emblematic: Israeli forces demolished 140+ buildings, killed 52 Palestinians (23 civilians), and faced international accusations of war crimes.",
      "By the Second Intifada's end in late 2005, the toll was catastrophic: 3,223-4,789 Palestinians killed (including 700+ children, 47% civilians); 1,024-1,100 Israelis killed (including 300+ children, 64% civilians); 45,000+ Palestinians wounded; 7,500+ Israelis wounded; approximately 40,000-50,000 Palestinians imprisoned; and massive infrastructure destruction. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in August 2005 while accelerating settlement expansion in the West Bank. The separation barrier was constructed‚Äîdeclared illegal by the International Court of Justice‚Äîconfiscating thousands of acres of Palestinian land. The Second Intifada destroyed what remained of the peace process, entrenched the occupation, empowered Hamas, and created the siege of Gaza. It established patterns that continue today: Palestinian resistance met with disproportionate Israeli force; suicide bombings used to justify collective punishment; negotiated peace deemed impossible. The human cost was immense on both sides, but the political outcome was clear: Israeli control deepened while Palestinian freedom receded further."
